# European Asylum Charts Using Plotly

These charts were inspired by the [Makeover Monday 2019/W28 challenge](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w28). The data can be found at the same link. The original data source is from [Eurostat](http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?dataset=migr_asyappctza&lang=en), and the original visualization is from the [European Asylum Support Office (EASO)](https://www.easo.europa.eu/asylum-trends-annual-report-2018)

Two versions of this HTML file was created to show the analysis:

- [a version without code](https://samedwardes.github.io/euro_assylum/European_Asylum_noCode) so the reader can focus on the charts [(R markdown)](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/euro_assylum/blob/master/European_Asylum_noCode.Rmd).
- [a vesion with the code](https://samedwardes.github.io/euro_assylum/European_Asylum_withCode) so the reader can see exactly how the data was manipulated and the charts were created [(R markdown)](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/euro_assylum/blob/master/European_Asylum_withCode.Rmd).
